# Assignment 2: Data Compression using Discrete Cosine Transform in TelosB Mote
Made by: Morten Sahlertz, Trung Thai, Andreas Arberg and Jacob Kj√¶rager

## Introduction
This project seeks to implement the Discrete Cosine Transformation on a TelosB Mote. The mote is running the Contiki OS. 
The project is successfull, and the M-sizes of the Cosine transformation component are regulated to observe a lower Mean Square Error.

## Technologies
To this assignment two different technologies has been used. This is an DCT implementation in C and data visualization in Python

### Discrete cosine transformation
The primary technology used for this task is the DCT. The technology is used in this context for compressing an ECG signal to be more energy effective to transmit from a constrained device as the TelosB mote. 
An example to how a DCT can be implemented in C can be seen at the Figure below. \

In the code snippet a couple of parameters are given. This includes the following: 
- N is the length of the original signal
- M is the amount of Cosine components that should be on the output 
- x is the original signal
- y is the output buffer with the cosine components which should be on the size y[M]

### Data visualization
To compare the two signals(original and the reconstruced from the DCT), a Python based data visualization implementation has been made. This will display the results in a generated .html-file with the help from the libary Plotly. The html-files can be seen in the Illustrations folder.  

## Experiment
The 512 and 256 byte ECG signals are generated, and compressed with the function with different M-values as seen on the Figure above. When this is done the output and the original message will be written to two .txt files and transfered to a laptop. On the laptop the signals are visualized for comparison with the use of the Python based framework Plotly.

## Results 
The results section is divided into two sections with regards to the 512 and 256 tasks. 


### 512 byte assignment
The 512 byte assignment is implemented with a M-value of 120. The result is visualized below.

MSE: 0.000207\
The time taken for this to happen is found to be:\
![alt text](https://github.com/Dudeslam/Wu-Tan-Lan/blob/master/Assignment2/Illustrations/512_time.png?raw=true) \
The time is found with 1 Cosine component and the overall time is therefore 120 times the found value (The image says seconds, however the found value is in milliseconds)\

This will give an energy consumption of:\
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=117240ms*1.8mA*3V=633mJ"> \
The mA and voltage is the average consumption taken from the TelosB mote's datasheet.

### 256 byte assignment 
The 256 byte assignment is implemented with a M-value of 75. The result is visualized below.

MSE: 0.000316\
The time taken for this to happen is found to be:\
![alt text](https://github.com/Dudeslam/Wu-Tan-Lan/blob/master/Assignment2/Illustrations/256_time.png?raw=true) \
The time is found with 1 Cosine component and the overall time is therefore 75 times the found value.\
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=75*488ms=36600ms"> \
This will give an energy consumption of:\
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=36600ms*1.8mA*3V=198mJ"> \
The mA and voltage is the average consumption taken from the TelosB mote's datasheet.

## Conclusion
The project is succesfull and the DCT is properly implemented on the TelosB mote. The reconstructed signal is pretty good and the MSE is pretty low. This is considered to be a good implementation and the tradeoff in accuracy for a 76% reduction in size for the 512 byte case and 71% reduction for the 256 byte signal. However the function seem to be time consuming, and thereby also energy consuming. A possible fix for this could be the implementation of fixed-point arithmetics.
