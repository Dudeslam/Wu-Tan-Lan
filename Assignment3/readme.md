# Assignment 3: Channel Sensing
Made by: Morten Sahlertz, Trung Thai, Andreas Arberg and Jacob Kj√¶rager

## Introduction
IEEE 802.15.4 uses ISM band 2.4 GHz frequencies. This assignment tries to measure the noise/interference at each different channel.

## Technologies
To this assignment two different technologies has been used. The RSSI is found through the mote and the CC2420 C library, the data visualization is done in Python

### Data visualization
To compare the sixteen RSSI signals a Python based data visualization implementation has been made. This will display the results in a generated .html-file with the help from the libary Plotly. The html-files can be seen in the Illustrations folder.  

## Results 
Let's see
